## Karl's Travel Guide- https://young-escarpment-82623.herokuapp.com (Site) https://github.com/cdyall/project-deux (Repo)
Our project is a new app which is similar to Yelp, but with a focus on niche activities in cities around the world. Feed your innate human desire to find new places to explore with the power of Karl's Travel Guide. Most often, when people travel to a new city, while they want to see the well known places, most people want to hit where the locals go. If you travel with Karl, a local guide is always by your side. 

## Why Karl's Travel Guide?
When it comes to travel sites, most tend to focus on the popular touristy places. If you go on Yelp, for every hidden gem and hole in the wall type of place, you need to go through a bunch of results for tourist traps and the well known places. Karl's Travel Guide is different because of it's focus on the less well known spots. 

## Karl's Travel Guide uses Bulma
Bulma is a free, open source CSS framework based on Flexbox and used by more than 150,000 developers according to their website.

## Features 
Karl's Travel Guide is built around a community of locals, showing off the cool restaurants, places to see and be seen in their community. A focus on local business would allow for a sense of community among users and the small business community. It has been shown via studies from media outlets such as the New York Post and USA Today that young people today love traveling and love supporting locally run businesses, even if they cost more for the same goods at a big chain establishment. Karl's Travel Guide is perfect for the traveler who prefers local, small businesses. 


## Code Example

 var $AttrDiv = $("<div>");
      $AttrDiv.addClass("col-sm-3");
      $("#attrlist").append($AttrDiv);
      var USER =  $("<h2>").html(travel[i].ID + " , " + travel[i].USERNAME);
      var Attraction = $("<h3>").html(travel[i].ATTR_NAME);
      var City = $("<h4>").html(travel[i].CITY);
      var State = $("<h4>").html(travel[i].STATE);
      var Country = $("<h4>").html(travel[i].COUNTRY);
      $AttrDiv.append(USER);
      $AttrDiv.append(Attraction);
      $AttrDiv.append(City);
      $AttrDiv.append(State);
      $AttrDiv.append(Country);
      $("#attrlist").append($AttrDiv);

## Installation

## How To Use
The beauty of Karl's Travel Guide is its simplicity and ease of use. An easy to navigate UI without clutter leads the end user through a rewarding, fun and informative expereince online leading to real life memories. 

## Issues and Solutions
One issue that the group ran into was a lot of these ideas were difficult to put into practice during the development phase. For example, insomuch as the spirit of the app is based on local, small businesses it is possible to include chains and well known places as well due to any posts being immediatly visible. One solution would be a team of moderators who would approve all submissions to the site. Another option would be for moderator created pages showing off tourist spots which could then be rated on by users. We also want to add further functionality moving forward in terms of new locations.
